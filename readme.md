### [Documentation](#documentation.md) page

------------

## c_array_support.hpp

Depends on std `<type_traits>` header.

### Concepts

* `ltl::c_array<T>`          matches C array (and references to array)
* `ltl::c_array_unpadded<T>` matches C arrays with no padding (and refs)

### Aliases

* `ltl::c_array_t<T,N...>` maps variadic Args to array type -> `T[N][...]`
* `ltl::flat_element_t<A>` remove_all_extents, under any reference qualification
* `ltl::flat_cast_t<A>` maps possibly nested array `A` to flattened array type  

### Traits

* `flat_size<A>` yields the total number of elements in flattened array `A`
* `same_extents_v<A,B>` predicate to tell if `A` and `B` have the same extents

### Functions

* `subscript(a,i)` returns `a[i]`, an rvalue if the argument is an array rvalue.
* `flat_index(arg,i)`returns `a[i]`;
 the element at index `i` of the flattened array.

------------

## array_compare.hpp

Depends on std `<compare>` for three-way operator <=> support.

### Concepts

* `ltl::three_way_comparable` [`_with`] (c.f. std)
* `ltl::equality_comparable`  [`_with`] (c.f. std)
* `ltl::totally_ordered`      [`_with`] (c.f. std)
* `ltl::pointer_equality_comparable_with`  (no std equivalent)
* `ltl::pointer_less_than_comparable_with` (no std equivalent)

### Aliases

* `ltl::compare_three_way_result_t` (c.f. std)

### Functors

* `ltl::compare_three_way`     (c.f. std)
* `ltl::equal_to`              (c.f. std)
* `ltl::not_equal_to`          (c.f. std)
* `ltl::less`                  (c.f. std)

------------

## array_assign.hpp

Depends on std `<concepts>`

### Concepts

* `ltl::default_assignable` (no std equivalent)
* `ltl::assignable_from` (c.f. std)

### Functors

* `ltl::assign` (no std equivalent)
