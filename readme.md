## `c_array_support.hpp`

Depends on std `<type_traits>` and C++20 features. 

This header provides traits and utilities for handling C arrays in generic code such  
as in `array_compare.hpp` and `array_assign.hpp` below.
Nested arrays benefit  
from helper functions that factor out recursions.

(Nested C arrays are not much used in C++ but generic code should support them).

Zero-size arrays: The utilities are carefully coded to accept `T[0]` where possible.  
Standard `type_traits`   fail or give erroneous results for zero-size array, including  
`std::is_array<int[0]>` which evaluates `false`,
but zero-size array is an array!

This header provides alternative implementations for std traits that work with `T[0]`.

### Alternative versions of `std` traits, robust to `T[0]`

>Note: this is not a complete set of replacements
for failing `std` traits.  
These provided traits are the ones that proved most useful so far.

* `ltl::is_array_v`
* `ltl::is_bounded_array_v`
* `ltl::rank_v`
* `ltl::remove_extent_t`
* `ltl::remove_all_extents`
* `ltl::remove_all_extents_t`

### Concepts

* `ltl::c_array<T>`          matches C array, including reference-to-array type
* `ltl::c_array_unpadded<T>` matches C arrays with no padding

### Aliases

* `ltl::c_array_t<T,N...>` maps variadic `N...` to array type -> `T[N][...]`
* `ltl::extent_removed_t<A>` remove_extent, under any reference qualification
* `ltl::all_extents_removed_t<A>` same for remove_all_extents
* `ltl::flat_cast_t<A>` maps array `A` to flattened array type, preserving cvref

### Traits

* `flat_size<A>` yields the total number of elements in flattened array `A`
* `same_extents<A,B>` predicate to tell if `A` and `B` have the same extents

### Functions

* `subscript(a,i)` returns `a[i]`, an rvalue if the argument is an array rvalue.
* `flat_index(arg,i)`returns `a[i]`;
 the element at index `i` of the flattened array.

## array_compare.hpp

Depends on std `<compare>` for three-way operator <=> support.

### Concepts

* `ltl::three_way_comparable` [`_with`] (c.f. std)
* `ltl::equality_comparable`  [`_with`] (c.f. std)
* `ltl::totally_ordered`      [`_with`] (c.f. std)
* `ltl::pointer_equality_comparable_with`  (no std equivalent)
* `ltl::pointer_less_than_comparable_with` (no std equivalent)

### Aliases

* `ltl::compare_three_way_result_t` (c.f. std)

### Functors

* `ltl::compare_three_way`     (c.f. std)
* `ltl::equal_to`              (c.f. std)
* `ltl::not_equal_to`          (c.f. std)
* `ltl::less`                  (c.f. std)

------------

## array_assign.hpp

Depends on std `<concepts>`

### Concepts

* `ltl::default_assignable` (no std equivalent)
* `ltl::assignable_from` (c.f. std)

### Functors

* `ltl::assign` (no std equivalent)


Zero-size arrays are disallowed in standard C and C++ (except in  array `new T[0]`).  
Compilers support a C extension that admits zero-size array as the final member of  
a struct (C99 standardized use of `T[]` for this purpose; FAM flexible array member).

The worry is that adjacent same-type zero-size array objects would not be iterable.  
C++20 `[[no_unique_address]]` attribute deals with this issue for empty classes.
